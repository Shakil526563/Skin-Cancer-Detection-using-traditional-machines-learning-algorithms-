In this project, you are addressing the task of skin cancer classification using a combination of image preprocessing, feature extraction through a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and subsequent classification using traditional machine learning algorithms.

Image Preprocessing:
Your preprocessing pipeline involves several key steps:

Median Sharpening: Utilizing median sharpening to enhance image details and improve the overall quality of the skin cancer images.
CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization): Applying CLAHE to enhance image contrast, which is particularly useful for medical images to highlight subtle details.
Feature Extraction using Deep CNN:
You propose a deep CNN model for feature extraction. Deep CNNs are powerful tools for learning hierarchical features from images. The model is trained on skin cancer images from Kaggle to automatically learn relevant features, capturing both global and local patterns indicative of different skin cancer types. The extracted features are crucial for subsequent classification.

Integration of Multiple Features:
To enhance the feature representation, you attach several features extracted by the deep CNN model. This integration of multiple features aims to provide a richer and more comprehensive representation of the skin cancer images, potentially improving the performance of downstream classification models.

Traditional Machine Learning Classification:
After extracting features, you employ traditional machine learning algorithms for classification. These algorithms could include, but are not limited to, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, or k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). The integrated features serve as input to these classifiers, which then learn to distinguish between different skin cancer classes.

Note:DeepCNN and Preprocessing code are hidden for some condition.
